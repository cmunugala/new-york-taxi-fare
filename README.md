# new-york-taxi-fare

The goal of this project was primarily to learn how to use PyTorch to train neural networks. To do so, I found the New York Taxi Fare challenge on Kaggle, which provided a simple setup that would be perfect for learning a new skill. This a predictive modeling project where I aim to predict the fare for a taxi ride in New York. Data and labels for this supervised learning task were provided by Kaggle. 

The notebook is provided as a pdf, as well as a jupyter notebook. 


Skills highlighted in this project:

- Machine Learning/Neural Networks (PyTorch)
- Feature Engineering
- Data Visualization
