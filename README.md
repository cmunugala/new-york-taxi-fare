# new-york-taxi-fare

This a predictive modeling project where I aim to predict the fare for a taxi ride in New York. Data and labels for this supervised learning task were provided by Kaggle. I used this simple project as a starting point as I am learning to use PyTorch to build neural networks. This project is still in progress. 

The notebook is provided as a pdf for viewing. 


Skills highlighted in this project:

- Feature Engineering
- Data Visualization
- Machine Learning (PyTorch)
